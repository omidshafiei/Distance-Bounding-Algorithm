# Distance-Bounding-Algorithm
Designing and Proposing a Secure Communication algorithm for RFID Networks
## Description
Upon the required application for RFID networks, distance bounding algorithms have been designed to achieve unilateral and mutual authentications. But these algorithms are vulnerable to the following five attacks:  mafia fraud, distance fraud, distance hijacking, impersonation fraud. This project proposes two authentication algorithms. The first proposed algorithm yields upper false acceptance rate (FAR) against two important attacks:  mafia fraud and distance fraud by utilizing predefined and random challenges. The second algorithm is proposed to control FAR against the aforementioned attacks. Moreover, these algorithms are completely resistant against distance hijacking. The FARâ€™s of these protocols are evaluated by mathematical analysis and closed form equations are derived. Also, the derived equations have been verified by simulation results.

## Simulation Result
As the number of itteration has been set on a high value (10^8 and 10^9), the theoritical and simulation results are almost similar.
