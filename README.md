# Distance-Bounding-Protocol
Designing and Proposing a Secure Communication Protocol for RFID Networks

Upon the required application for RFID networks, distance bounding protocols have been designed to achieve unilateral and mutual authentications. But these protocols are vulnerable to the following five attacks:  mafia fraud, distance fraud, distance hijacking, impersonation and terrorist fraud. This project proposes two authentication protocols. The first proposed protocol yields upper false acceptance rate (FAR) against two important attacks:  mafia fraud and distance fraud by utilizing predefined and random challenges. The second protocol is proposed to control FAR against the aforementioned attacks. Moreover, these protocols are completely resistant against distance hijacking. The FARâ€™s of these protocols are evaluated by mathematical analysis and closed form equations are derived. Also, the derived equations have been verified by simulation results.
